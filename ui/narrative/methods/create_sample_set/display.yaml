    platform :
        ui-name : |
            Platform
        short-hint : |

        ui-name : |
            Domain
        short-hint : |
            The domain of the genome (prokaryotes vs. eukaryotes).

    <p>This App allows users to select the single-end or paired-end read files and provide the metadata for a set of samples to create an RNASeqSampleSet object. Note that the user must provide reads for at least two samples.</p>

    <p>Users need to import single-end or paired-end read objects to the Data Pane before starting this App.</p>

    <p>It is mandatory for users to select the "Library Type", "Domain", "RNA-seq Sample and Condition Labels," and provide the "RNA-seq Sample Set" (RNASeqSampleSet object name). All replicates for the same condition must have same label.</p>

    <p>Users can optionally fill in additional metadata information in the advanced options.</p>
